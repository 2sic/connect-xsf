# CSS Framework Codes

This is the full list of CSS-Framework codes. Please use only these in published material. 

_If you need a CSS Framework which is not yet listed here, please suggest it in a [new issue](/DNN-Connect/connect.koi/issues/new) - we'll evaluate it according to our [rules to adding css-framework codes](#rules-for-adding-css-frameworks)._

## CSS Frameworks and their Unique Koi Codes

* `all` reserved to mark things that apply to all frameworks

* `unk` reserved to mark things that apply when the framework isn't known

## Rules for Adding CSS-Frameworks

These are the general rules we use to manage CSS Framework codes:

1. CSS frameworks must be public (so no private frameworks in the public standard)
1. The framework must still be actively maintained - so dead framework like YAML, Skeleton or 960gs will not be added, as we don't expect new components to be created for these frameworks
1. CSS frameworks must have a minimal user base to be added
    1. at least a few thousand sites across the internet
    1. or at least a few thousand stars on Github
    1. or at least 100 sites in one of the primary Koi-supported platforms like DNN

## CSS Frameworks Regarded as Dead

The following CSS frameworks appear dead and not actively maintained any more, so were explicitly not added to the standard list of CSS frameworks:

* [YAML](http://www.yaml.de/)
* 1140 Grid
* 960gs
* Skelleton
* YUI
